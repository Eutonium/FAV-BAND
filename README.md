They say musicis food for the soul and I totally agree.What we listen to can easily describe a person's character widely.The term HIPHOP refers to a complex culture comprising of deejaying,rapping,graffiti,painting and B-boying.The migos hiphop band is an American hihphop band base in Atlanta,Georgia formed with help of rapper and CEO Gucci Mane.Since then,they have recieved numerous award despite ups and downs in their music journey.Listening to their songs helps one to view life with a different perspective.
